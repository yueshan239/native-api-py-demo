# native-api-py-demo
This is a demo of IRIS Native API for Python, which uses Python to call the Object Script method and flow the message in production. Python obtains the message after flow and the message in global, and uses ZPM Package deployment.

### Firstly, we need to install the Native API package

Enter on the command line

`pip install intersystems_irispython-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl`

### Then, we import the Object Script code into studio

### Then, we modify the namespace, uesename, and password to make the information consistent with IRIS
